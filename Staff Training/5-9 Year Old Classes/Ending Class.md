# Ending Class
[Training Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PBOHy_juoZ2LO8mgft7GxB3IcUFcAiaR/view?usp=drive_link) ~5.5 minutes in length
## Asking For Their Favorite Part of The Class
* Ends class on a positive note
* Gives feedback to you on what they liked, so you can lesson plan accordingly
* Allows students time and space to talk with you and build that personal connection
## "Clap For Yourselves and Each Other"
* One way I like to encourage dancers to show gratitude and repsect to everyone in the class
## Saying Goodbye To Each Dancers Individually
* Having a moment to thank, encourage, and say goodbye to each dancer as they exit the class
  * Aiming for a minimum of 3-5 moments of individual interaction with each dancer
    * As we greet them on their way into class
    * As they go across the floor and work on skills in small groups (should have several moments of interaction here)
    * As they exit class for the day
