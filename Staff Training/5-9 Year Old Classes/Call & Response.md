# Call & Response
[Training Video]() ~7.5 minutes in length
## Structure
* For younger classes it can be helpful to start with hand clap rhythms first
  * This eliminates them having to focus on what the step itself is and they can focus more on listening/learning the rhythm and repeating that back
  * Can make the exercise feel less daunting since it just clapping at first
* Let them know that some parts will feel really tricky and some parts will feel really easy so they don't feel bored/overwhelmed based on the level of difficulty
* Add shading of volume to get them thinking about the quality of the sound as well!
## General Tips
* If dancers keep asking for water, it's often helpful to let them know how far away we are from our next water break. Ex: We are going to do two more across the floor combinations then we will get water and then work on the combo for today
* Try to minimize talking during this activity. I don't typically give notes/corrections at all. I just give them the space to do their best and follow along
* If you see they struggled with one of the rhythms maybe try repeating it a few more times to give them a second (or third or fourth) chance to get it!
* Maybe repeate the same exact rhythm with different steps and see if they notice it
