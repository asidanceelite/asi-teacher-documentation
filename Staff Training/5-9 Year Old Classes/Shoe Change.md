## Brining Belonging Back To Their Spots
* Have dancers change their shoes in their spots in order to prevent chaos from happening in front of the cubbies and shoes getting mixed up
* Prevents dancers from getting stepped on or hurt if the cubbie are gets crowded
## Providing Structure
* Giving them a specified time frame to change shoes and get their water
* Providing them some sort of stretch or exercise to work on after they've finished changing their shoes to keep them using their time wisely and being productive
