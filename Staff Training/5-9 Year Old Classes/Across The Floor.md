# Across The Floor
[Training Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ROi80b_YRVsYs7oNuphIh7te9_dgacEL/view?usp=drive_link) ~ 12.5 minutes in length
## Structure
* Dancers line up in the back of the room on the back marley tape
* Going across the floor two or three at a time
* Grouping dancers with other students the same level as them
  * This helps us provide variations of the across the floor combination based on what difficulty level they need
* Encourage the dancers to use their full space and keep practicing all the way across the floor
* Try to not give notes/corrections until they get about half way to give them time and space to make self corrections before we step in
## General Tips
* If teaching a new combo or giving feedback to the whole group, it's oftentimes helpful to have the dancers come back and sit on a tape and watch/listen to the feedback before going across the floor again
* Don't be afraid to have them repeate the combo across the floor again if they need additional practice. The groups that have it can do a more advanced version the second time through if needed
* Don't be afraid to give them something a little out of their current comfort zone/ability if they've been doing that particular across the floor combo for a while and are ready to be challenged more
