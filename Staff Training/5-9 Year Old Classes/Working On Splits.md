## Utilizing Yoga Blocks
* Instruct dancers to choose a height for their blocks that is most beneficial for their bodies
* Blocks on either leg with hands on top of block
* Body upright nice and tall
* Dancers should begin on their knees, place the correct leg in front, and slide through the blocks into their splits
* Check that their knees and toes are turned out
* Blocks help guide the dancers' legs straight forward in their splits
