[Training Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11aSmDlLjscg2KDC74cK29d7PVLGk5bMQ/view?usp=drive_link) ~16.5 minutes in length
# Structure
* Working on the same step but in different tempos
* Work on steps that require weight change as this can be tricky for their age but is very important for dance (especially tap)
* Ask them questions as often as (if not more often than) you give them information
  * How many sounds are in this step?
  * Are we using out the balls of our feet or our whole foot for this step?
* Focus more on warming on concepts than specific steps
  * Weight Change Steps
  * Ball of your feet steps
  * Rhythm Change
  * Tempo Change
  * Changing Arm Placement
  * Etcetera
* Don't be aftraid to challenge them out of their comfort zone
* Utilize the purple spots in addition to the white taps for weight change steps
## General Tips
* Set very clear expectations around when they should have quiet feet and how you signal that you need their feet to be quiet
  * This helps prevent you from having to shout over 16 tap shoes
* Change up the music choices between songs they know and songs they don't
* Always welcome dancers that are coming in late during warm up so they feel welcomed coming into your class
* If you have a TA have them lead the warm up, call and repeate, etc.
