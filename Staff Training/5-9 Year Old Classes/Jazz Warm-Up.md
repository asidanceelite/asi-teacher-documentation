# Jazz Warm-Up 
[Video Training](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IDaYnvKAQHcvcj7hpzNNZW1vNO4NEDM4/view?usp=drive_link) ~7.5 minutes in length

Please note that I didn't show a ton of stretches here as those are the things we as teachers can usually easily integrate. It's more of the niche things like stabilzation and core work that may be trickier for you to integrate in an age appropriate and engaging way. So I focused more on those activities in this video
## Stabilization Work
* Passe Balance
  * Change up arms for extra fun
  * This can also be done by adding a developpe once they get good at this base version
 ## Core Work 
 * Arms in first feet in pike, laying down in slow motion as you give them a count down
## Keeping Turn Out In Straddle Stretches
* Have dancers pretend that there are ice cream cones on the tops of their toes and they have to keep their toes pointed up to the ceiling the entire team in order to keep them from falling off
  * Dancers will typically self correct with this imagery in play
## Utilizing the Floor
* It is oftentimes much easier to fix technique when dancers are performing the movement seated or lying on the floor. This allows them to focus on the work and not on having to work on the execution + the stabilization
  * Floor battements lying down
  * Seated side extentions
  * Passe pirouette positions (arms + legs) lying on their back. Focus on engaging core and squishing back flat to the floor
