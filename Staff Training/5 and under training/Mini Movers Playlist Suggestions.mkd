# Tap
* [Tap Goes My Little Toe](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_dyRdqzUsMLlTdybPM0K1b7mmm&trackAsin=B0CCK8J4QV)
  * Good for heel digs and toe digs (or toe taps)
* [Toe Back Together](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_ry3mHeihrpPulWaPKJYj54J36&trackAsin=B0CCK8VDFR)
  * Another one of my favorites!!
  * I use the purple dots behind their feet so they have a target for their toe backs
* [Tap Heel Toe](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B07VQRHPRC?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_qMb33hUKCpsr95U8SNSA4ugyC&trackAsin=B07VPMM78W)
   * I bounce with hands on hip during the instruction transtitions to work on keeping time and keep them engaged
* [Shuffle Step](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_EqpUWe4h2Io9TwR1ZuN55b0jl&trackAsin=B0CCK89RRN)
  * For this song I like to bring in a white ballet barre and lower it as low as it will go. Then I have them come to the barre facing the mirror 3-4 at a time, play the song and have them practice shuffle steps. I also go around 1 at a time and help them. At the end during the interlude before the song is over I have them take three steps back and take a bow at the end
* [Shuffle Stamp](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_kmlPhcyENY4vByl30kjbbvmV5&trackAsin=B0CCK9BMX3)
  * This one is good to do all together in the center before are after doing it in small groups

# Ballet
## Stretching
* [How we move our toes](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_0sCl6wxWBp94CijoyYgK68TzO&trackAsin=B0933RT7VP)
  * A good song for pointing and flexing as well as straddle stretch positions
* [Stinky Toes Stretch](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_VZ2WYppxz4Hnu7hqgfdFaQZtD&trackAsin=B0CCK8R1JQ)
  * Butterfly stretch song
* [The Lalala Song](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B005EWO4ZG?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_mej0Ee83YuBWyAy6EaY8y88oh&trackAsin=B005EWO5SW)
  * A fun song to stretch to with good visuals. Some parts will need you to fill in with movement, but there are also good prompts already included as well
* [A Very Moving Medley](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00BBWU8V2?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_So5N1FphxI0m1GD8FLOL9EC8P&trackAsin=B00BBWUD94)
    * I like to use the first song as a stretch song
      * The first time through I do it in a straddle (arms up, forward fold, then side stretches)
      * The second time through I do it standing (arms up forward fold, side to side stretches)
      * The last time through I do it standing but on the side to side we forward fold and touch each foot one at a time
    * Depending on what I want to work on that day, I might use the other songs or I might not.
## Skills 
 * [Watch Me Kick - Vocals](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00Q5232JS?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_C1DBKIlljWMNHkPJTUBwTEvoN&trackAsin=B00Q5236TY)
   * I do battements in place during the vocals then talk through other skills (plies, bourrees etc) during the interlude
 * [Balance - Vocal](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00Q5232JS?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_3Q5G7G5dYhrineenRCZc84tG7&trackAsin=B00Q523964)
   * For this agae I don't do a full on balance, we just sway and work on weight shift while swinging our arms
* [This is First Position](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_hMXSCaA7AHFMo3750qwK8rFJW&trackAsin=B08GBBSQ91)
    * You can do this with arms or feet! I always start with arms as they are easier for the kiddos to grasp. I teach first position from the very beginning of the year as well and add second towards the winter time
* [Technique Tada](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_XxuDjoBZhyAR73gRmf4PcXHnB&trackAsin=B08GC3H7C7)
    * I'd make a big deal out of becoming the character before starting this song. Maybe even bringing a scarf and making up a new name when you become "Ballet Mistress Marceline" or whoever. Maybe even take it a step further, after you've reviewed your ballet skills say it's time for Ballet Mistress Marceline to come see how amazing your technique is today. Say you're going to go get her while Ms. Verna/Ms. Torie (whoever you TA or co-teacher is) makes sure you are ready in first position with hands on hips. Put on your scarf, hat, or whatever prop you have for the character and come in with a big fancy accent and being really over the top to see their amazing ballet technique. This can be super silly and fun, but I bet they'd be really engaged and on their best behavior for Ballet Mistress Marceline (:  
* [That's How a Plie Goes](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_DHPoxw82ptd3Gwyh1JwVbbRqf&trackAsin=B0933PGJX5)
* [My Releve](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_cpt2cwHBJ3w9GcVQ2ykmClRUv&trackAsin=B093479L2H)
* [I Can Do My Tendu](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_QrgfkRGzaxEVSwJIAI0JhiLUc&trackAsin=B0933QXXJ4)
  * To teach tendus I have them "paint" their toe names any color they want and then show it to themselves in the mirror.
  * Because this gets so fast I recommend doing the right foot only the first tiime it goes through the song, then doing the left foot on the second iteration when it repeats
* [To Make a Passe](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_lnKHz5aYldlWwGu1rkgb9EkxI&trackAsin=B0934GRF6K)
* [I'm an Arabesque](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_QakaxC5LFZXd1JSldMqBAgz5Z&trackAsin=B09347D953)
  * I'd probably start this one like I do the shuffle steps. Bringing in my baby bar and doing 3-4 at a time with the bar and moving around to give notes and corrections to each dancer to fix their techniqu
* [Ballet Party](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B09KBWP9L1?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_hOLHNaRYCIOcad0j1mrHIHc2G&trackAsin=B09KBYV821)
  * A great review of lots of different ballet skills
    * But you will definitely need to use filler movement in between the skills
* [Plie and Tendu](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_hR4yNXt4xBCOGDJxlo9d3xJ3k&trackAsin=B0CCK6J3JK)
  * One of my favorites!! I do one foot the first time and one foot the second time it repeats
* [Saute Freeze](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_GvDg1MS4jsklA8A0cLXu4F2uU&trackAsin=B0CCK7WVCV)
  * This is a crowd favorite. Before the song I have them stand in first with hands on hips. I go around quickly one at a time and hold "an apple" (my hand) a little above their head and have them go apple picking with their head. They have to jump up and hit my hand with their head. Then once we have started if anyone isn't jumping, I simply go over and hold my hand over their hand and they join in again
  * I also have them hold the freeze in plie!
* [Flowers in the garden](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B005EWO4ZG?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_H2DUlZ1Sb3s0lybwJAjUcAQb6&trackAsin=B005EWO6HC)
  * Very similar to my flower story concept. On the chorus I like to let them improv moving all around the room, but then come back to their spots for the next skill review section.
# Miscellaneous
* [Happy Birthday Dance](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B09KBWP9L1?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_eQstp7mRxNGiwK3RGRkrF8LAm&trackAsin=B09KBZ6YB5)
  * When it is someone's birthday they can come up to the front with the teacher and help lead the birthday dance! (:
* [Quick Change Your Shoes](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_FuWg66vWYodbDWII0p9hnUaxi&trackAsin=B0CCK7PF8F)
  * I place this song in the background during shoe change
* [If You're Happy and You Know It Instrumental](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B07PY1H5SH?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_Doyq7jxOVtdP7uib3zh0PW4Q6&trackAsin=B07PWV1L3S)
  * I do a plie and passe review to this song. I do plies twice on "if you're happy and you know it clap your hands" then two claps. Repeat. Then swaying balances. For stomp your feet a do passes. Shout hooray depends on the focus that month, it could be sautes, bourrees, or whatever the focus skill is
* [Come Dancing With Me](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00E91QJKQ?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_w0tcm7978ULFBrpDlJKcCawEs&trackAsin=B00E91QK7S)
  * I've used this a variety of ways in class in the past, but I might use it for recital this season
* [Icky Sticky Bubblegum](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0013PL1P4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_bZhnIBtBtPb8iygmTzr4Ea3qc&trackAsin=B0013PF55G)
  * This one is super silly. On the icky sticky bubble gum parts I have us rub our hands together while reviewing skills (first time plies, then tendu, then saute, etc)
* [Fast and Slow](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B07CZ524K3?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_4SwwUXsLBQ63sXCDNMo89N1kW&trackAsin=B07CZ4JJ71)
  * I use this for improv work. We get scarves and have to dance based on the speed given (slow or fast)
    
# Gross Motor Development
* [Stand up, sit down](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00E44FXX2?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_4EIsilLFPj44szckwNVM8n934&trackAsin=B00E44G9VM)
  * I make this silly by being dramatic about the stand up sit down part. I have them do each movement in threes (clap clap clap - hold - clap clap clap - hold) to work on rhythm and timing
* [Shake Your Body Down](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B07B42G85P?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_PFq45oQP7Kvffz8wahjIFh1i8&trackAsin=B075M4N7YX)
  * I always add scarves to this song
* [Skipping Time](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00FAXP6EC?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_J3LsFCWSbKq8ccdCqFlexvKKl&trackAsin=B00FAXPAGG)
  * For this songs I have us practice traveling in a circle (not just all around the room like I usually allow)
* [I Really Love To Dance](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00H7VJWLI?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_NMRWpYAoreyrJyepUGkFIVV5s&trackAsin=B00H7VK10E)
  * Pretty customizable. I tend to use it during tap and work on certain steps during the chorus and then follow the instructions for the prompts section
* [This is How I Do It](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B01ISJPL8A?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_h9xq8YOjKqEfiPVbOGHfAUmbA&trackAsin=B01ISJPZDQ)
  * Can add in dance steps or gross motor actions during the "this is how I do it" parts
* [Bean Bag Bop](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B004PA5C7W?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_3MK0junLdF3XdGjphvy4fE6ol&trackAsin=B004PADNBO)
  * I end up throwing in tap steps during the chorus to tie in a quick and fun skill review

# Freeze Dance or Stop and Go Songs
* [Stop and Go](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0014BU7NO?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_WQKiMlfMsHzLAyOfdOpxV3b87&trackAsin=B0014BVYA4)
  * Really emphasize that they have to remember the sound of each song. It's a fun memory game for them
* [Animal Rap](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00BCCOXHG?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_iWX7QkgDnlz9znm33CFPNsv6o&trackAsin=B00BCCOZG0)
* [Rocketship Run](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B07CZ524K3?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_8y9jg9biIYEJ9ucRWuKpvr1ph&trackAsin=B07CZ4B2KN)
   * A few things I do to keep this song super engaging and a crowd favorite:
     * We use noodles as rocketships. When it's counting down we are on our spot, crouched down, and all counting down 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 then when it says blast off, they jump up and hold their noodle up high. Then we move around based on the prompt (jumping, spinning, etc) all around the room.
     * Right before the next count down we have to run back to our spot and get ready to blast off again!
     * At the we all use the noodle as a pillow and lay down to go to sleep. Once the last countdown starts we get crouched for our final giant blast off!
 * [The Goldfish](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0B52J6JPZ?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_7MTENRpSY5EqBe5uXX9E59EuR&trackAsin=B0B52G5J2F)
   * A well loved classic
   * I like to use noodles for this song! We make them into pillows when sleeping. We hold the in our hands as handle bars, sit on our bottoms, and pedal our legs during the bike ride portion (great core exercise). We use it as a loofah for the shower part. And pretend (emphasis on pretent) it's a giant tooth brush for the teeth part. 
* [Waving My Scarf Stop](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_gmL36isUT64eGUzulOQWPQkME&trackAsin=B08GBM5RS5)
  * Obviously a good one to use scarves with (:
* [Galloping in a circle warm up](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_joi7NppBV3GUD08mkVvozLZFl&trackAsin=B0934DLSD1)

  * On the verses (this is a special song you have to put your ears on...) I give different prompts. So the first one might be move all around however they want, the second passe walks around the room, the thirst battements, etc
* [The Airplane Song](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B07DXCPWR1?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_ANnbrS4Amjv5YY1fAnW6F1oHi&trackAsin=B07DXDP371)
  * Get back in your airplanes part I have them do airplane arms and practice running and doing jettes around the room
  * Slow it down and land on the room part we have to land on our spot in a seated position then get up and follow the movement prompt
* [The Party Freeze Dance Song](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B015KAUZW2?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_Ys91QmMdl485okqrW5MUHQ5Pa&trackAsin=B015KAV1YS)
* [Dance, Freeze, Melt](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B004CCXBWG?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_uZ9aaGS3kSmqr9ZgoJsORBCh6&trackAsin=B004CCZ4Y4)
  * Perfect for when you start going over how we count in dance
* [Freeze Dance](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00CBUNVIU?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_y7pTMvMFoNjwbJvBq61edM0jK&trackAsin=B00CBUNW3O)
  * This intro is a little long so I tend to fast forward it. I like to add scarves to this song for extra fun
* [Walking Walking](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00N6K5HXG?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_9tbIpWPi5MsXWhixuKYhPQL1Q&trackAsin=B00N6JSPLS)

  * A Bop. I love it because it's a more dancey version and upbeat
* [The Clean Up Song - The Kiboomers](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B074G5LWRC?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_io4mEmHUTLLaDO8HQVcRlgqdR&trackAsin=B074G4R85W)

 # Halloween Songs
* [Halloween Party Freeze Dance Game](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B01L977BYK?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_ajgUUiiRvbSzTWizgNQ5Unnke&trackAsin=B01L977DOS)
  * I let them use scarves and at the end of each verse I have them hide behind their scarf and try to scare me by pulling it down and saying "BOO!" when it says boo
* [Witches in Ballet](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08MZF8PL2?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_YJDQYwib7VjQbkeVm2XpVfuIc&trackAsin=B08MZG8BNH)
* [Monster Boogie](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B09JV5RB39?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_MHtuC6WsSCkqz82HpiUvusrLY&trackAsin=B09JTWYTZM)
  * It isn't a follow along song with instructions so you have to choreograph this one yourself but it's fun halloween themed
* [Here We Go On Tippy Toes](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0019GONOS?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_2gpoqpqCMFyOr9vDqgeaSVSfV&trackAsin=B0019GQ5T4)
  * I have everyone try to make a scary face and say BOO! when it says boo to try to scare teacher!
* [Pass The Witches Broom Stick](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0019GONOS?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_ghGTDBSLiKVkaflgWKAyRNSYJ&trackAsin=B0019GOFB4)
  * Can be very fun but they have to have their best listening ears! I use noodles for witches brooms but if you're crafty you can make a cute little broom. The most I usually do is stuffing a scarf into one end and calling it the broom straw
 
# Songs I Haven't Tested In Class But You Can Try Out!
* [First Position Plie Plie](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_7Tuyuwks7Glq1h7V8R9UaHCD3&trackAsin=B08GCCRXNT)
  * More of an end of the year song once they know their positions better and have stronger focus to make it through all of them in one song. You can start the year by just practicing the first position part. Then over the next few weeks start doing first and second.
* [What is it Called](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_TYRL4HSbVsivTMQNsTpjVM8QR&trackAsin=B08GBZH5YZ)
  * I haven't used this yet but definitely will after I've introduced all of these skills as a review for the names of the skills.
  * I'll choreograph something on the non-ballet step portions
* [Words we say in ballet](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_jHb6xdHRJxE7qafXOb1CMTKLY&trackAsin=B0933NDFJL)
  * Another version/option of the song above
* [Arabesque Arabesque](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_TYRL4HSbVsivTMQNsTpjVM8QR&trackAsin=B08GBZH5YZ)
  * I'd probably start this one like I do the shuffle steps. Bringing in my baby bar and doing 3-4 at a time with the bar and moving around to give notes and corrections to each dancer to fix their technique
* [Port De Bras Pizza](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_TYRL4HSbVsivTMQNsTpjVM8QR&trackAsin=B08GBZH5YZ)
  * Oh my gosh I love this. I just found it today and will save it for when we focus on arm positions next month but this will be so much fun!
* [Ballet Ballet 1, 2, 3](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_Cr9Cu51QGdASbGaAhs90o0oWI&trackAsin=B08GC4RT88)
* [It's Fun To Kick Battement](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_MAvEvo5bmZga7id8z1ENCqHDO&trackAsin=B08GBY7YWR)
* [Goodbye Ballet](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B08GC3Q1RN?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_kz8w9vBWIyT6wvxa6edSujoy7&trackAsin=B08GCCHX78)
  * Introduces bowing at the end and clapping at the end of class
* [Petit Jete](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_VzxQO9CUIyadfw9ppKa37qsDw&trackAsin=B0933QZHPM)
  * Again, definitely an end of the year song as they get more advanced. Could even be great for primary ballet that is on the younger side
* [Pique Battement](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_LX7p2tJ7ImLhll2298eFR9FYW&trackAsin=B0CCK96RC6)
  * I haven't used this one yet as we aren't quite ready for it but I have it queued for later in the year
* [Temps lie arabeque](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_3VwgUhDQeL8VGm06283mUuVcE&trackAsin=B0CCK8P2M4)
  * Including for Ms. Tina for primary ballet, Mini movers not quite ready (:
* [I can flap](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_WblCjB2B8j0Vh2W2qxKrK3LO9&trackAsin=B0CCK8CY7K)
  * A little too fast for right now but queued up for end of the year
* [Alphabet Song](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0040EU14W?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_Sb6XI2AshugsyosinAo2t2tjq&trackAsin=B0040EXMV6)
  * I'm experimenting with adding a lights off, 2 minute slow follow along stretch/meditation portion of class. This would be a song I would use as it is slow, quiet, short, and recongnizable. I'll try it out on saturday and see how it goes. My old studio did a 2 minute lie down brain rest for the kids part way through and teachers would come around and stretch each dancer one at a time. For now I might do a 1 minute follow along stretch and then a 1 minute lie down rest meditation. We'll see
