# Tap
* [The Weather Song](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B07VQRHPRC?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_z3A0Vkh4Fto6b48VbTYR6RzDC&trackAsin=B07VLDLCL4)
  * I skip to 26 seconds
  * Great for sitting in a circle and using the different parts of your taps
* [Tap Goes My Little Toe](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_dyRdqzUsMLlTdybPM0K1b7mmm&trackAsin=B0CCK8J4QV)
  * Good for heel digs and toe digs (or toe taps)
  * I do fun gross motor movements during the instrumental part at the end
 * [With My Foot I Tap, Tap, Tap](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B009C5X6BO?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_HpuLo35rGlwjplQk7Av3fmQHp&trackAsin=B009C5X84O)
   * One of my favorites!
   * You can either sing and do it on the instrumental version or switch it up for fun gross motor movement instead during the interude
* [Toe Back Together](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0CCK8CCN9?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_ry3mHeihrpPulWaPKJYj54J36&trackAsin=B0CCK8VDFR)
  * Another one of my favorites!!
  * A little tricky of this age group but can be good as they get used to toe backs or if your class is on the older side
 * [Tap Heel Toe](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B07VQRHPRC?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_qMb33hUKCpsr95U8SNSA4ugyC&trackAsin=B07VPMM78W)
   * This one is a little long for this age group. I usually keep an eye on their attention span and either only do the toe taps or only do the toe taps and heel digs. Just depends on your class.
   * I bounce with hands on hip during the instruction transtitions to work on keeping time and keep them engaged
* [Tap Your Toe and Follow Me](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0013PHWPC?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_SAAUR2DDHh57Op9WX6vjL4ISI&trackAsin=B0013P7IWO)
  * I like to use this in a circle during tap 
# Ballet
## Stretching
* [I'm A Little Teapot](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00S0FOOUY?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_5NCsNNOZQz7diDIQn1KBOEXJV&trackAsin=B00S0FOSH8)
  * I do a sit down stretch for this song. Usually I do butterfly stretches, wave both hands one at a time on the hand and spout part, roll my hands on "when I get all steamed up hear me shout" and gently follow over on tip me over and pour me out
  * I switch up the style of butterfly stretch on each verse. So maybe we start by flapping our wings, then the second time we do butterfly forward fold, and then end with a frog stretch on our belly
* [Hickory Dickory Dock](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B003CXKLTM?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_A79kwuc1YlASH15SWz0OY3BG1&trackAsin=B003CXOKLM)
  * I do straddle stretch to this song. I have them start with big side to side bodies touching their toes, they make the number 1, then do side to side again. The second time I do a forward fold straddle stretch. To do this I pay the floor really close to me (like drum roll style) then I do the same by patting reeeeeally far away for a big stretch, they show number two and repeate. I then go back to side to side stretches and finish with the forward fold stretch again
*[How we move our toes](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0934C47H4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_0sCl6wxWBp94CijoyYgK68TzO&trackAsin=B0933RT7VP)
  * A good song for pointing and flexing as well as straddle stretch positions
## Skills 
* [Baby Ballet Plie](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0BB6GCFPC?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_5C3wTH2btgwimpiLbqOt3pDou&trackAsin=B0BB6GSBZ3)
  * It's a little long so I either do just first position, or just first position once and second position once
* [Demi Plie](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B09F1MWGWH?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_ZZxiqlGE7wWtguYyvBwkcaoGV&trackAsin=B09F1PXMZY)
    * Short and sweet! Making it perfect for this age group (:
 * [Watch Me Kick - Vocals](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00Q5232JS?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_C1DBKIlljWMNHkPJTUBwTEvoN&trackAsin=B00Q5236TY)
   * I do battements in place during the vocals then talk through other skills (plies, bourrees etc) during the interlude
 * [Balance - Vocal](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00Q5232JS?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_3Q5G7G5dYhrineenRCZc84tG7&trackAsin=B00Q523964)
   * For this agae I don't do a full on balance, we just sway and work on weight shift while swinging our arms
 
# Miscellaneous
## Gross Motor Development
* [Baby Dancing Time](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0BB6GCFPC?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_YZYwh4H7Af3s6G5OkrHmEEBlG&trackAsin=B0BB6FTZK7)
  * A great circle time song to start class! Gets them moving and is super fun and energetic to get them engaged from the beginning! I used this one right after we say hello to everyone to get the party started
* [Head Shoulders Knees and Toes](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00N6K5HXG?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_rftLrBmbjegxWdqMCwcjTepz7&trackAsin=B00N6JNK86)
  * I do this once seated in a pike (good pike stretch introduction) and then do it standing the second interation to help keep them engaged
  * I love this cover because it is on the slower side for this age group! A lot of the other versions are a little too fast
  * I play one song for shoe change to keep the energy up. It can be whatever you want but it should be pretty consistent so they know that that song playing means it is time to change for ballet
* [Shake My Sillies Out](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B01N6X00VB?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_QYuwdkswE3fcUZmYtclRw5p2u&trackAsin=B01N16ZZRK)

  * This can be made into a ballet version (uses butterfly stretches and other ballet movements) or a tap version (sitting on bottom tapping toes when they splash in the water) or just a silly gross motor song. Very transformable to suit your needs!
* [If You're Happy and You Know It](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00S0FFQMO?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_wQ9DbRpTU6jsUjIzGRZ3lp7bW&trackAsin=B00S0FFTJY)

   * A good song for marching in a circle (then jumping, tippy toes, etc)
* [Clap Your Hands](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0013AZMYK?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_pDmuPVaF2e1HnpRzORO99slf4&trackAsin=B0013AF628)

  * A good body part review. I let them shake them and move all around during the chorus then we stop in one place and follow instructions on the verses
* [Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Turn Around](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00MHH3BB4?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_w1fYNKx9lsxjf2aj0PPrKPDeW&trackAsin=B00MHH3LLY)

  * This one is great for when they just need to get some energy out! 

## Freeze Dance or Stop and Go Songs
* [Walking Walking](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00N6K5HXG?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_1cnK9w1s3NYgqo9mDnIZzfLOt&trackAsin=B00N6JSPLS)

 * [Stop and Go](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0014BU7NO?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_WQKiMlfMsHzLAyOfdOpxV3b87&trackAsin=B0014BVYA4)
   * Really emphasize that they have to remember the sound of each song. It's a fun memory game for them
 * [Animal Rap](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B00BCCOXHG?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_iWX7QkgDnlz9znm33CFPNsv6o&trackAsin=B00BCCOZG0)

   * A few things I do to keep this song super engaging and a crowd favorite:
     * We use noodles as rocketships. When it's counting down we are on our spot, crouched down, and all counting down 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 then when it says blast off, they jump up and hold their noodle up high. Then we move around based on the prompt (jumping, spinning, etc) all around the room.
     * Right before the next count down we have to run back to our spot and get ready to blast off again!
     * At the we all use the noodle as a pillow and lay down to go to sleep. Once the last countdown starts we get crouched for our final giant blast off!
 * [The Goldfish](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B0B52J6JPZ?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_7MTENRpSY5EqBe5uXX9E59EuR&trackAsin=B0B52G5J2F)
   * A well loved classic
   * I like to use noodles for this song! We make them into pillows when sleeping. We hold the in our hands as handle bars, sit on our bottoms, and pedal our legs during the bike ride portion (great core exercise). We use it as a loofah for the shower part. And pretend (emphasis on pretent) it's a giant tooth brush for the teeth part. 
* [Gallop Little Horsey](https://music.amazon.com/albums/B006LZ0OPO?marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&musicTerritory=US&ref=dm_sh_K9AYjCT6VumXNlUb2C3zzQMIc&trackAsin=B006LZ0QIY)
 * I use scarves as pillows and we lay down sleeping on our spots then we do different dance movements around the room depending on the animal. We also do a stretch at the end of the song on the slow outro
